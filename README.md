[LTTR/INK](https://www.lttrink.com/?utm_source=glpgh&utm_medium=inkap&utm_campaign=gl2&utm_content=glpghlk&utm_term=lttrink) is the stroke contrast tool **inspired by Gerrit Noordzij’s The stroke: theory of writing**. Prototype rich stroke shapes of your letters with **skeletons** and use the stroke styles for **parametric** type design.

The LTTR/INK becomes an immediately familiar tool and fun to play with.

Simulate calligraphic tools: **Broad Nib**, **Pointed Pen**, **Pointed Brush**, **Flat Brush**, **Marker**
